Under the giant pine tree, a gray wolf(Canis Lupus) cub was born in the vast field of Yellowstone. And its name is Fortem. He was a wolf with silver colored fur and a pair of eyes that were as bright as a shining diamond. Under the beam of the sun, Fortem&rsquo;s mother Amora was taking care of Fortem and sitting beside the rock. At that time, Fortem was running around and feel curious about everything he saw. Amora looked at Fortem with a sight of hope and happiness. She thought he would be a great hunter and a great gray wolf. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; After a while, Amora and Fortem returned to their pack and they disappeared in the dense, large forest.</span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 602.00px; height: 401.33px;"><img alt="" src="images/image9.jpg" style="width: 602.00px; height: 401.33px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">6/14/1997</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">Yellowstone National Park</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Dear Diary,</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Now it is already summer. And today my mom is about to teach me how to hunt and get food for myself. Now I just have to follow my mom and other pack members to the area they often hunt. In the way to the area, we saw dense trees and other plants. In a distance, we can also see the giant snow mountains that are surrounding us like monsters. It actually look very terrifying to me. Whatever, it is not a living thing.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; After a few minutes, my mom and others suddenly stopped and creeped down. Mom also said:&rdquo; Creep down and follow me. There is an elk.&rdquo; I don&rsquo;t really know what an elk is, but I think it is an animal that have large horns. Anyways, I creeped down and looked forward with mom.</span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; Then, mom moved into a bush quietly. I tried to follow but I may or may not made a big noise. In a distance, I saw the creature with a large horn running away. Now everyone is chasing the horned creature and I decided to catch up with the pack and followed them. It was an intense chase, we passed over trees and trees, hills and hills. It kept on for at least half an hour and finally everyone stopped and formed a large circle. I ran to the circle and saw the horned animal was in the middle of the circle stuck. We are closing into the animal. And then, dinner time. We had an big fat elk to eat for today. And it was so delicious.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; When I ate the dinner, I asked mom:&rdquo; Why do we not eat the grass like the elks?&rdquo; Mom responded:&rdquo; Oh child, it is because we only eat meat and the grass are not delicious at all. You can try it if you don&rsquo;t trust me.&rdquo; I tried the grass and it was really bad, just like mom said. I just cannot hold the smell of that thing, ew.</span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 602.00px; height: 366.67px;"><img alt="" src="images/image2.jpg" style="width: 602.00px; height: 366.67px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span>&nbsp; &nbsp;</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;It was a long day and I finally slept when the sky is dark and the tiny lights in the sky went out. In my dream, I became a great hunter. I even thought my dream was real. Since then, I thought I am really interested in hunting.</span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; In the morning, the burning hot sun went out and the sky become blue. I don&rsquo;t want to wake up yet but mom pushed me and said:&rdquo; Let&rsquo;s go, it is not safe here.&rdquo; I thought it was really weird because why is it not safe, yesterday we literally went on hunting. I asked mom:&rdquo; What is it that is dangerous, mom?&rdquo; She didn&rsquo;t respond and grabbed me quickly. I looked back and saw a giant brown thing in a distance. I ran as quick as I could. And finally the thing is gone and I asked mom what is it. She said:&rdquo; It was a grizzly bear and it would attack us. Luckily we escaped.&rdquo; I was so scared their that I couldn&rsquo;t even move.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; We kept walking and I saw an eagle flying in the valleys, I wished I could also fly like that beautiful creature in the white clouds.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; We walked over mountains and mountains, rivers and rivers, cliffs and cliffs. Finally we arrived at a place that have absolutely no trees. Mom said this place is called the plain. And we kept on walking. When we&rsquo;re in the plains, I saw yellowish green grass, ponds, and rivers. Sometimes I even saw something like the brown thing I have seen in the morning but I looked more closely and it was more like a giant cow with fluffy body. I also noticed the pack was staying away from those things, so I ran to the large cow myself.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; When my mom noticed I was gone, she chased behind me and howled the loudest I&rsquo;ve ever heard. I turned &nbsp;around and saw the fluffy furred cow looking at me as if I meant to do harm. And then it rush to me as if it is crazy. I ran towards mom, and the cow was still chasing me. It was even more scarier than the grizzly thing in the morning.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; When the cow gets 2 meters away from me. Mom and the others ran to me as quick as they can, and got me out of there.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c7">&nbsp; &nbsp; It is night again, and everyone returned to the pack. Some are hurt and some are well, all because of me. I thought I would never do such a thing once again. I felt really bad. I fell to sleep quickly.</span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 602.00px; height: 434.67px;"><img alt="" src="images/image5.jpg" style="width: 602.00px; height: 434.67px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span>&nbsp; </span><span class="c0">&nbsp;During my sleep, I dreamt of my dad and I thought where is my dad. Did he leave us and why.</span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; In the morning, everyone are in a bad mood. And I asked mom where is dad. She soon become more sad than before:&rdquo; He was injured and killed by a male elk when we were hunting for food. He fought bravely but he still was hurt. He would never come to us again.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">11/27/1997</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">Yellowstone National Park</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Dear Diary,</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; Today is very cold and everything became as white as feather and snow fell from the sky. The trees are layered with snow and the lakes, rivers are frozen with ice. Everything changed. We are still in the Valley of The Wolves and we found a nice place in the mountains. We can rest their and nobody really would want to disturb us. And hopefully we can all survived through these tough months.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; Right now in the mountains, there are definitely fewer elks. For example normally there would be 2 group of elks appearing in a day, but now there might be only 1 group of 0 group of elks per day. In the winter, we would most likely eat smaller animals like rabbits&hellip; They don&rsquo;t even fill my stomach for a little bit.</span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 602.00px; height: 254.67px;"><img alt="" src="images/image8.jpg" style="width: 602.00px; height: 254.67px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</span><span class="c0">Now it is December and the coldest of all winters, all the animals are almost gone. Even the elks. There are now only 1 group of elks per 4-5 days or something. It is very very terrible.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;One day, we finally saw a group elk and everyone is super excited. The pack quickly chased the elks without thinking and catched 2 elks in total. I think our 12 wolf group would still be starving. In the afternoon we already ate the first elk and we decided to eat the second elk in the night, so we don&rsquo;t get hungry when we sleep.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; Something terrible happened when it was night, the elk have been eaten already. Mom soon know that another pack was coming to our territory and eaten all the food when they were starving. Now how are we going to have dinner?</span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Another day and I heard an unusual howl from the forest near our territory. I woke mom and everyone else by just a small wolf howl and every member of the pack stayed alert and formed a battle position. I knew it was the other pack of wolves that ate our food yesterday.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c7">After a few minutes, the other pack of wolves appeared in the dense white forest. They were ferocious. The fight soon happens, both of our packs charged to the opposite one and started fighting. In the mess, I don&rsquo;t know what to do. I thought our pack was losing and that means they will take over our territory. The worst thing is they might kill us. In the fight, mom told me to run away and said:&rdquo; Fortem, you are already a grown wolf. You could handle everything, I don&rsquo;t want you to get hurt. So go!&rdquo; I ran quickly and feel like I would never see my mom again. I didn&rsquo;t even have chance to say goodbye. I ran down the mountain.</span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">5/6/2002</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c7">Yellowstone National Park</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Dear Diary,</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c7">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Today, I&rsquo;m 6 years old already and I joined another pack in the Valley Of Wolves. The leader is called Ferus and he is actually very mean and he always commands us</span><span class="c7">&nbsp;with his thought. I feel like I should be the leader of the pack for thes</span><span class="c7">e long already. Also, sometimes I will think about my mom in the night and in the dreams but it has already happened and it cannot be changed. So I will try my best </span><span class="c0">for mom.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c7">&nbsp; &nbsp; When</span><span class="c7">&nbsp;I get to this pack</span><span class="c0">, we got way less food than before. When we&rsquo;re in my mom&rsquo;s pack, we will get 1 or 2 elks per day. But now we only caught 1 or 2 elks per 2 days. And most of the food goes to the pack leader Ferus. It is not fair at all. So for the few days after, the same thing keep happening.</span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 602.00px; height: 401.33px;"><img alt="" src="images/image4.jpg" style="width: 602.00px; height: 401.33px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; </span><span class="c0">One day in the morning, the giant bright sun woke all of us and suddenly the pack leader says we need to go to hunt for more food. I thought that was not a super good idea but we all still got with it. In my pack, we have 10 wolves and I&rsquo;ve made friend with few of them. They help me if I had any trouble so I felt respectful to any of my friend. And we kept on walking for the whole morning. Near the giant waterfall we&rsquo;ve found a deer wandering on the mountains, Ferus said quietly:&rdquo; Be quiet and let&rsquo;s get the thing. This one is mine.&rdquo; I nodded but actually I didn&rsquo;t feel comfortable about this. And the chase began, we ran towards the deer in an incredible speed. In the chase, I found out that I was the quickest in the hole pack. Even Ferus didn&rsquo;t feel comfortable and said:&rdquo; Be slower Fortem, you are even quicker than me now.&rdquo; It felt really bad because if I catch that thing, we will have a good day. But Ferus wanted me to stop. I must follow his instruction because else I will be kicked from this pack forever and I don&rsquo;t want that to happen. I stopped and I followed behind.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; After a while, the deer was gone and everyone is desperate. Now Ferus said I was wasting his time. I had a very bad feeling with Ferus since then.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; Ferus still didn&rsquo;t give up after the failure of the deer chase. We walked up the mountain and we see a cougar under the trees. Now Ferus is even more insane than before, he wanted us to kill the cougar. I bet it is a great risk. I tried to advise it to Ferus but he said:&rdquo; Who are you, you don&rsquo;t even know how strong our wolves are. So don&rsquo;t advise me.&rdquo; Now I have no more idea than not do it. I also told my friends and others to not follow his instructions, and most of the wolves agreed.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; Ferus turned back and said:&rdquo; Everybody, stay back. Now look how I can defeat the cougar thing.&rdquo; I just stayed back.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; When the cougar saw Ferus, the battle began. First Ferus tried to attack the cougar, but he failed. And next the cougar hits back and it definitely hurt Ferus. When the cougar got ready for another hit. I ran to Ferus and I pushed him away. I thought it was dangerous but it is worth a try. But Ferus still went to the front and battle the cougar with revenge. Now I know Ferus is probably going to die.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; I was correct. The cougar hit him more than 3 times, he fell to the ground and down the cliff. He is gone for sure.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; Now everyone is quiet. And some of the wolves are sad. Everyone is desperate and the pack needs a new leader now.</span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; When we found a nice spot to rest. The battle for the leader began. The challenge is the first to hunt an elk and bring it back to the resting place.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; First, I ran quickly to the hunting area. It took about few minutes. Luckily no one have ran pass me yet. When I waited until the sunset, I&rsquo;ve saw a elk going by. I jumped out of the bush and bite its neck. I got the elk. The next thing I do is carrying the elk to the resting place. The elk is super heavy and the pack said it would be hard as well. But finally, in the full moon. I got the elk to the pack and I was second. I thought I was first, there were no other members quicker than me. I felt very strange and very sad. It is my only chance and I&rsquo;ve failed it. In the next day the ceremony began, the other wolf is about to be the leader. When that is happening, a wolf said loudly behind me:&rdquo; Hey, stop the ceremony. I saw that the wolf cheated, I got evidence.&rdquo; My heart suddenly became so delight. I feel like that I would be the leader now.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I grabbed my only chance and everyone come with the wolf. We got to the prey that the winner wolf got and when we turn it around, we saw a bite from a cougar, which is pretty common in the mountains. Everyone can&rsquo;t believe their eyes. The winner wolf cheated to get the win.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c7">&nbsp; &nbsp; After the reveal of the cheater, I was chosen to be the leader of the wolves. In that second I feel the feeling that it&#39;s like a mix of joy and a mix of pressure. I cannot believe I am the leader of the wolves.</span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 602.00px; height: 452.00px;"><img alt="" src="images/image7.jpg" style="width: 602.00px; height: 452.00px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c6"><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; </span><span class="c0">7/11/2002</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">Yellowstone National Park</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Dear Diary,</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; I have been the leader of the pack for months now and I did a great job. Everyone could get many food. Now it is the season where leaves fall, and that means winter is coming. So we need to prepare for the hardest season of the year. This will be my first winter as a leader and I need to try my best to do it.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; One day when we were wandering in the forest to hunt, I saw a wolf laying on the ground. There I felt a feeling that I&rsquo;ve never felt before. I went to her and I found that she was attacked by the same pack of wolves that made me apart from my mom and my old pack. I didn&rsquo;t even think that they were this close to us.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; I brought her to our resting place for tonight and she woke when the star appears. She said with a very confused voice:&rdquo; Hey, where am I and why I&rsquo;m I here.&rdquo; I answered her:&rdquo; We&rsquo;ve found you in the forest hurt, so I brought you to our pack.&rdquo; She said:&rdquo; Thank you but I still need to go back to my&hellip;&rdquo; &ldquo;No, most of them were captured by the other pack. They got my mom and other members of the old pack before.&rdquo; I said. After I said that, she nodded her head and lowered it down. She felt the sadness in her heart and I can completely understand that. So I left her and waited to the morning.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; In the morning, she was awake early and I had to go to her as fast as possible to see if she is better than yesterday. I said:&rdquo; Hello, are you feeling alright today.&rdquo; She said:&rdquo; Good, and thanks for everything you did to help me.&rdquo; I said:&rdquo; You&rsquo;re welcome. By the way, my name is Fortem.&rdquo; She said:&rdquo; My name is Beta.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; When Beta got in our pack for at least 2 months, we got in love and we decided to pair up. For days and days we stayed together with our pack, and now the pack got even more food than before. We all appreciated her for everything she did. We got through a lot of obstacle in months. For example like bears, cougars, even poisonous snakes.</span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 602.00px; height: 358.67px;"><img alt="" src="images/image3.jpg" style="width: 602.00px; height: 358.67px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">3/19/2003</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">Yellowstone National Park</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Dear Diary,</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; Now it is the beginning of summer and something like miracle is about to happen. We are going to get children. After days and days from now, we got 4 little wolves. 2 boys and 2 girls. We named 1 Blizzard, 2 Poten, 3 Aspen, 4 Arnou. And it is an amazing day. I&rsquo;m going to be a dad wolf!</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; When the hot yellow sun went out, the little wolves moved around. They put their little heads on us and they jumped around with joy. I felt the happiness in my heart and this is the most exciting moment in my whole life. Soon the other wolves from the pack came and all of them wished us luck.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c2"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 602.00px; height: 401.33px;"><img alt="" src="images/image1.jpg" style="width: 602.00px; height: 401.33px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; </span><span class="c0">After 10 or more days, the little wolves opened their eyes. They recognized us with their little small bright eyes. And since then, I took care of them for every second.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; Now it is Autumn, it&#39;s time to teach these little fellows how to hunt and survive. I remembered how mom teached me and I told these guys step by step. First we went on hunting with our pack and these little guys. They were surprisingly good at it. When we saw our first elk, they learnt quickly and when we saw our second prey a rabbit. They surrounded it and had their lunch. We kept practicing for the rest of the year and after that, they were experts. Sometimes even better than us. We went to the rivers to see the otters, fish, beavers&hellip; And we also went to the geysers to see the majestic eruption of the hot water. (We did bunch more things.) These are all the things we did in the past few months. But the happiness didn&rsquo;t continue for very long.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; When we were at the plains at the park, Aspen was killed by one of the wolves of the pack that got my mom and killed Beta&rsquo;s pack. I&rsquo;ve became so mad and so desperate their that I wanted revenge on the pack.</span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">4/3/2003</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">Yellowstone National Park</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Dear Diary,</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; This time, the other pack is starting a war with us. We are all prepared, we&rsquo;ve got our supplies. I am ready to take revenge. And we&rsquo;re going to end this battle with victory. Then, our pack arrived to the battlefield on the plains. Both of the side of wolves look strong and powerful. So the battle seems a little even. And then with the command of the other leader wolf in their pack saying attack, the packs battled. When it is almost night, the battle is over and we&rsquo;ve won. We made the other pack scared of us and retreat. Of course our pack was also heavily hurt. At least the other pack shouldn&rsquo;t attack us anymore. When we rest down in the battlefield everyone is okay even if almost all of us are hurt. I think we can all live a normal life now.</span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">6/8/2010</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">Yellowstone National Park</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; Me and my family lived nicely and happily after everything that happened and when I was 13, my children are all full grown but me and Beta are in an age. I felt the weakest I&rsquo;ve ever felt and sometimes I can&rsquo;t even open my eyes. My family and my pack are with me when I was decoying like a dead rose. And I look back my life sometimes, overall it was successful. I had my children and Beta. Also my own pack. Now I&rsquo;m going to go back with my mom and the old pack. I&rsquo;m sure that my family would be sad but I told them it is okay.</span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 602.00px; height: 452.00px;"><img alt="" src="images/image6.jpg" style="width: 602.00px; height: 452.00px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; </span><span class="c0">Under the bright sun, in the Valley of Wolves. The 14 year old wolf Fortem had his last breath and he closed his pale white eyes. He is in an age already, he must follow the rule of nature. And he must leave space to the newborn wolves and other species. Even if he had to leave his family and the valley where everything happened. He wished for the best for his family and he wished his generation could go down forever. His wish came true as his soul flies to the sky and the generation of Fortem lived in the Park of Yellowstone until now.</span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c4">THE END</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c4">Made By Rocky Jia</span></p></body></html>
